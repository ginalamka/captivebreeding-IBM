Note: Use of the provided code requires a specific configuration of folders. Within the directory holding all of the provided scripts, there should be three folders:source, plot, and output. All .R files that execute the simulation, except for RRSmodel.R, are found in source  into the 'source' directory. After defining parameter values within RRSmodel.R and running the code, all output files will be directed into the 'output' directory. All code for plotting and parsing the output are found in the plot directory.
